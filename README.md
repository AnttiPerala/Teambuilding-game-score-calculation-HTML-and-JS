# Teambuilding game score calculation HTML and JS

Allows you to easily calculate the score between two teams playing against each other with team building cards.
All future team members should first create their personal skill cards with 20 points distributed between four different skills and print them out. Then two groups are created, which take turns in selecting cards, trying to hit the perfect balance in the team creation. The closer to a balanced team a card brings the table, the bigger the score. 
This app allows you to choose the size of teams resulting from the game (between 2-8 players).
